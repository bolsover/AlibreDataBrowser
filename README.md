# AlibreDataBrowser
Alibre Data Browser

A C# project designed to allow users to browse Alibre data files and display Design Properties.

Note that the project has only been tested against Alibre V24 and that there is no warranty for the application.
Your attention is drawin to the included Copyright and License text.

Currently, the application allows changing of the Alibre Design Property for description.

The project distribution does NOT include the required AlibreX.dll; you will need to add that file to the project before it can be compiled.

The project is generally tested using the Jetbrains Rider IDE but it should work equally well with Visual Studio 2022.
